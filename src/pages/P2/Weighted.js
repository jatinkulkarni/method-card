                                <strong>Background: </strong>The Design Strategies Certificate provides students with a multidisciplinary framework in design thinking. To address the challenge of course selection, we interviewed students and utilized the weighted matrix method to help them personalize their own course selections.

                                <strong>Problem Statement: </strong>Students pursuing the Design Strategies Certificate often struggle to select among the wide array of classes offered. With a diverse range of classes, students may find it difficult to select courses that align with their interests and career aspirations. This can lead to suboptimal course selections and inability to maximize the benefits of the certificate.
