# Design Thinking Game

This project is a game designed to gamify the **Design Thinking** process. It engages users with dynamic prompts, allowing them to explore the iterative steps involved in refining ideas within a user-centric environment. The project was built using **React**, **JavaScript**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Firebase** in Fall 2023. The game enhances both theoretical learning and practical application through an interactive, online experience.

## Features
- **Interactive Gameplay:** Guides users through phases of the Design Thinking process.
- **Dynamic Prompts:** Provides dynamic, scenario-based prompts to aid users in learning and applying Design Thinking principles.
- **Iterative Process:** Encourages refinement of ideas in real-time, similar to the actual design process.
- **Engagement-Oriented:** Designed to make the design process enjoyable, turning complex steps into simple, gamified interactions.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For creating a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity and game logic.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the web application.

4. **Prototyping Phase**:
   - **Digital Prototypes**: Wireframing.
   - **Service Prototypes**: Role Play.
   - **Physical Prototypes**: Rapid Prototyping.

5. **Testing Phase**:
   - **Qualitative Testing**: Love Letter, Focus Group.
   - **Quantitative Testing**: Walkthroughs, A/B Testing.
